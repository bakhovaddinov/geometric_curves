# Geometric Curves
Design a small program in C++, C#, Java or other object-oriented language that would implement support of
3D curves hierarchy.
1. Support two types of 2D geometric curves â€“ lines and ellipses. (See details below). Each curve
should be able to return a 2D point and a first derivative (2D vector) per parameter t along the curve.
2. Populate a container (e.g. vector or list) of objects of these types created with random or fixed
parameters.
3. Print coordinates of points and derivatives of all curves in the container at t=PI/4.
Requirements to the implementation:
1. The implementation must use virtual methods.
Curve definitions:
- All curves are parametrically defined, i.e. a point is calculated using some C(t) formula.
- Line is defined by its origin point O and direction D: C(t) = O + D*t.
- Ellipse is defined by its two radii, along X and Y axes.
